# Virtual-McSlap
This is the source code of Virtual McSlap, in Javascript. This project was for me to get experience with Javascript working with something im passionate about all while developing something useful for my school's League of Legends collegiate team. The bot is made with e-sports teams in mind. Virtual McSlap is a Discord.js bot which lets users schedule an upcoming match and various information about it. The team's schedule is readily available to be displayed upon the "!schedule" command. When the match is coming up, Virtual McSlap sends notifications to the @Player role in Discord. Upon match time, Virtual McSlap alerts and manages the removal of the match from it's storage.
